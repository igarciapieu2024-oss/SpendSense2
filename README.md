# SpendSense
SpendSense is positioned as the first digital solution in the Spanish ecommerce market, which turns shopping into a responsible and conscious act, helping you save, gain control, and reduce your environmental footprint, by calculating both the financial and environmental impact for every purchase 

# Description 
SpendSense is a Python-based web app developed as part of the Algorithms and Data Structures course at IE University.
The project applies multiple core algorithms learned in class. We used arrays, linked lists, Hash Maps, and OOP for data handling, to create a real-world solution that connects financial awareness with environmental responsibility.
